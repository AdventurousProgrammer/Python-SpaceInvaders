# Python-SpaceInvaders
This project is my version of Space Invaders using Python. I have added a few new features such as toggling through different weapons, having a variety of different enemies, not having barriers but having a health bar instead, and I am also thinking of adding multiplayer play as well.

Here is a basic visualization of the game play screen.

Along with the current weapon, which takes one shot to eliminate most enemies.

Basic Enemies can move horizontally or vertically up to a certain limit, and then they change direction.
